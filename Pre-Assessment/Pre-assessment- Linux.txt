1.Consider a text file which has multi-lines text, output all the lines which has a specific word and also output the total number of occurrences of that word


$ tr ' ' '\n' < FILE | grep WORD | wc -l
tr replaces spaces with new lines
FILE - give file name
Grep WORD- write the word whose occurrence you want to find 
Grep filters all the resulting lines matching words 
Wc - counts the remaining one




2.Search for all the files that have a ‘.txt’ extension in the current working directory


find . -type f -name "*.txt"










3.Execute a specific command in all the subdirectories whose names starts with “aws”. For example, your sub-directories are “aws_1”, “aws_2”, “gcp_1”, “aws_3”., Execute “pwd” command in the directories “aws_1”, “aws_2” and “aws_3”










4.Consider a text file and replace a specific word with any word of your choice
 Sed command is mostly used to replace the text in a file
Suppose you have file jags.txt


You have word koli in jags.txt and you want to replace it with panchal then command is
$sed 's/koli/panchal/'  jags.txt




5. How to find a specific file in the system
    find starting/path expression
    find /home/username/ -name "*.txt"
 This will find all files ending with txt in /home/username/ directory and all sub-directory


     find . -name jagruti.txt
This will find specific file jagruti.txt in current directory
